# Social_Media_Ads_Model
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a user will purchase a product after clicking on a social media advertisement. The objective is to use demographic features to classify purchasing behavior and help businesses better target their audiences.
## 📁 Dataset

- Features used:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Estimated Salary
- Target variable:
  - Purchased (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
  - ## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- ## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection
4. Train-test split
5. Model Building:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - XGBRFClassifier
   - KNNeighbours Classifiers
   - AdaBoost Classifier
6. Evaluation:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
   - Recall Score
   - ## 📈 Results

- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 89%
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 91%%
- Random Forest Classifier:92%
- XGBRFClassifier: 94%
- KNNeighbours Classifiers: 93%
- AdaBoost Classifier: 91%
- Best model: XGBRFClassifier
- ## ✅ Conclusion

This basic classification project demonstrates how demographic data can be used to predict purchase intent.
## 🔗 Project Status
